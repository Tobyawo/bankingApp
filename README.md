# About üöÄ

The Royal Reserve Bank is a digital banking solution built using microservices architecture, focused on using the latest Spring Cloud technologies along with Spring Boot to implement various architectural patterns such as service discovery, centralized configuration, distributed tracing, circuit breaker, centralized logging, cache-aside and event-driven architecture.
<p>
It consists of several independent modules that work together to provide a scalable and fault-tolerant system. The microservices communicate with each other through well-defined APIs and leverage databases for data storage to perform various banking activities, such as account creation, money transfers, asset management and sending email or SMS notifications.

# Microservices üìã

1. **Account API:** The Account API module provides functionalities for managing accounts. It acts as an account catalog and communicates with a MongoDB database. It allows customers to create new accounts, retrieve account details, update account information, and perform operations such as balance inquiries and transaction history retrieval.
<!--  -->
2. **Transaction API:** The Transaction API module handles the processing of financial transactions. It communicates with a PostgreSQL database to store transaction records. Customers can initiate transfers through this API. The Transaction API ensures data consistency by communicating synchronously with the Account API and Asset Management API to check the availability of funds and assets before processing any transaction.
<!--  -->
3. **Asset Management API:** The Asset Management API module communicates with a MySQL database that maintains asset data. This API enables customers to query asset availability, such as checking stocks, bonds, or other financial instruments. The Transaction API interacts with the Asset Management API to ensure that sufficient assets are available for transactions.
<!--  -->
4. **Notification API:** The Notification API module is responsible for sending notifications to customers. It is a stateless microservice that does not have its own database. Instead, it communicates asynchronously with other modules to send notifications after specific events, such as successful transactions or account updates. The Notification API leverages messaging system named Apache Kafka to ensure reliable message delivery and scalable notification processing.
<!--  -->
5. **API Gateway:** The API Gateway module provides a single entry point for customers to interact with the microservices. It acts as a reverse proxy, routing customer requests to the appropriate microservice. The API Gateway handles authentication, authorization, and security concerns, ensuring that only authorized requests reach the microservices. The API Gateway improves the overall system performance and provides a unified interface for clients.
<!--  -->
6. **Config Server:** The Config Server module centralizes the configuration management for the microservices. It allows the microservices to retrieve their configuration details from a centralized location, simplifying the configuration process. The Config Server supports features such as environment-specific configurations, and dynamic configuration updates without requiring service restarts. It enhances the maintainability and scalability of the microservices architecture.
<!--  -->
7. **Discovery Server:** The Discovery Server is responsible for service discovery within the microservices architecture. It acts as a central registry where each microservice registers itself upon startup. The Discovery Server enables microservices to locate and communicate with each other without hard-coded dependencies. It uses technologies like Netflix Eureka to provide service discovery capabilities.

- The different modules in the Royal Reserve Bank project work together to provide a comprehensive banking solution. They communicate with each other through well-defined APIs and leverage databases to store and retrieve relevant data. The microservices architecture enables modularity, scalability, and fault tolerance, allowing each module to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

# Solution Architecture üîç

The Royal Reserve Bank project is designed using a microservices architecture, which is a pattern that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. Each service represents a specific business capability and can developed independently. The microservices communicate with each other through well-defined APIs, enabling them to work together to provide a scalable banking solution.

## Architecture Patterns

The Royal Reserve Bank project leverages various architectural patterns to ensure scalability, fault tolerance, and maintainability of the system. The key architectural patterns used in the project include:

- **Service Discovery:** The microservices use the Discovery Server for service registration and discovery. This pattern enables microservices to locate and communicate with each other dynamically without the need for hard-coded endpoints. It improves the system's resilience and scalability by allowing services to adapt to changes in the environment and handle load balancing efficiently.
<!--  -->
- **Centralized Configuration:** The Config Server provides centralized management of configuration settings for all microservices. This pattern simplifies the configuration process and allows for dynamic updates without the need to restart services. It enhances the maintainability of the microservices and makes it easier to manage configurations in different environments.
<!--  -->
- **Distributed Tracing:** The project uses Zipkin, a distributed tracing system, to track and analyze the flow of requests across microservices. Distributed tracing allows developers and system administrators to understand the performance and behavior of requests as they travel through multiple microservices. By instrumenting the microservices with tracing code, Zipkin collects timing and tracing data, which can be used to identify bottlenecks, troubleshoot issues, and optimize the system's performance.
<!--  -->
- **Event-driven Architecture:** The Notification API module utilizes Apache Kafka, a distributed streaming platform, for asynchronous communication. Kafka provides a reliable and scalable messaging system that decouples the sender and receiver of messages. When a microservice needs to send a notification, it publishes a message to a specific Kafka topic. The Notification API, acting as a consumer, receives the message and processes it accordingly. Asynchronous communication allows the system to handle notification processing separately from the main request flow, improving performance and scalability.
<!--  -->
- **Database per Microservice:** Each microservice in the Royal Reserve Bank project has its own dedicated database. The Account API communicates with a MongoDB database, the Transaction API uses PostgreSQL, and the Asset Management API interacts with a MySQL database. This approach of having a database per microservice ensures data isolation and autonomy. It allows each microservice to manage its own data schema, optimize database operations based on specific requirements, and scale independently as needed.
<!--  -->
- **Cache-aside Pattern:** Caching plays a crucial role in enhancing performance and reducing database load in microservices architecture. The Account API utilizes Redis template, while the Asset and Transaction API leverage Spring Cache. When a request requires data, the microservice first checks the cache. If the data is available, it is retrieved from the cache, avoiding the need to fetch it from the database. This caching strategy efficiently reduces response times and enhances the overall performance of the system.
<!--  -->
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern:** The Circuit Breaker pattern is used to handle faults and failures in distributed systems. It acts as a safeguard to prevent cascading failures when a microservice is unavailable or experiencing high latency. The Circuit Breaker is implemented using resilience4j library in the Transaction API. If it detects failures or slow responses, it "opens the circuit" and redirects subsequent requests to a fallback mechanism or returns an error response directly. This helps to protect the overall system from overloading and allows it to gracefully degrade when dependencies are unavailable.
<!-- - **Centralized Logging:** In a microservices architecture, it's crucial to have a centralized logging system to collect and analyze logs from various microservices. Centralized logging enables easy monitoring, troubleshooting, and analysis of the system's behavior. The microservices in the Royal Reserve Bank project send their logs to ELK platforms (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana). These platforms allow developers and operations teams to search, filter, and visualize logs, making it easier to detect and diagnose issues, track system performance, and ensure compliance with security and operational requirements. -->
- **Containerization and Orchestration:** The microservices are containerized using Docker, allowing them to run in isolated environments with their dependencies. Containerization provides consistency in deploying microservices across different environments.
<!-- The containerized microservices are then orchestrated using a container orchestration platform called Kubernetes. Kubernetes manages the deployment, scaling, and monitoring of the microservices, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance. -->
- **Security:** The Royal Reserve Bank project incorporates security measures throughout the architecture. The API Gateway handles authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized requests reach the microservices. The microservices themselves follow secure coding practices and implement appropriate security controls, such as input validation, encryption of sensitive data, and protection against common vulnerabilities.
